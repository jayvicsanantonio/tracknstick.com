## Technical Implementation Details

### SyncQueue Architecture (Task 3.1)

**File:** `src/core/offline/sync/SyncQueue.ts:1-233`

#### Core Features

- **Operation Queuing**: `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `peek()` with automatic ID
  generation
- **Deduplication Logic**: Automatic merging of duplicate operations on same
  entity
- **Dependency Tracking**: Prevents execution of operations with unsatisfied
  dependencies
- **Status Management**: Complete lifecycle tracking with `markCompleted()`,
  `markFailed()`, `retry()`

#### Smart Merging Strategy

```typescript
// UPDATE operations merge data fields
existing.data = {
  ...((existing.data as Record<string, unknown>) || {}),
  ...((newOp.data as Record<string, unknown>) || {}),
};
```

### RetryManager System (Task 3.2)

**File:** `src/core/offline/sync/RetryManager.ts:1-310`

#### Error Classification Engine

- **Priority-ordered detection** to avoid false positives
- **Context-aware categorization** using message content and error names
- **Configurable retry strategies** based on error type

#### Exponential Backoff Implementation

```typescript
delay *= Math.pow(this.config.backoffMultiplier, retryCount);
delay = Math.min(delay, this.config.maxDelay);
const jitter = delay * this.config.jitterFactor * (Math.random() - 0.5);
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Priority Calculation Framework

- **Challenge**: Creating a flexible priority system for operation ordering
- **Solution**: Implemented placeholder with TODO(human) for collaborative
  implementation
- **Design**: Framework ready for multi-factor priority calculation (operation
  type, dependencies, timestamps, retry counts)

### Error Classification Accuracy

- **Challenge**: Distinguishing between different error types reliably
- **Solution**: Priority-ordered classification with specific indicators and
  fallback logic
- **Implementation**: Auth errors checked first, then specific HTTP codes,
  finally network patterns

### Test Isolation and Reliability

- **Challenge**: Complex IndexedDB mocking for sync queue operations
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive mock IDBManager with in-memory storage
  simulation
- **Result**: Fast, reliable tests with full operation lifecycle coverage

### TypeScript Type Safety

- **Challenge**: Handling unknown data types in operation merging
- **Solution**: Strategic type assertions with safe fallbacks
- **Implementation**: `Record<string, unknown>` for safe object spreading

## Build & Quality Verification

   including edge cases
3. **Type Safety Planning**: Consider unknown data handling patterns early in
   interface design
4. **Incremental Testing**: Run specific test files during development to catch
   issues earlier
5. **Build Verification**: Perform intermediate builds to catch compilation
   issues sooner

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Files Created**: 4 new TypeScript files (2 implementation + 2 test files)
- **Lines of Code Added**: ~800 lines of production code, ~400 lines of test
  code

## Educational Insights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────` **Operation Deduplication
Patterns**: The sync queue's ability to merge duplicate operations prevents
unnecessary server calls and maintains data consistency. By merging UPDATE
operations and replacing others, the system optimizes for both performance and
correctness. `─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────` **Retry Strategy Design**:
Error categorization enables context-aware retry behavior. Network errors get
exponential backoff, while auth errors stop immediately. This prevents resource
waste while maximizing sync success rates.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────` **Dependency Management**: The
queue's dependency tracking ensures data integrity by preventing operations from
executing out of order. This is crucial for maintaining referential integrity in
offline-first applications. `─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

## Next Steps Recommended

Based on the task specification, the next logical implementation would be **Task
4**: "Implement connectivity monitoring" which includes:

- Enhanced ConnectivityMonitor class with multiple detection methods
- Debounced status change notifications
- Network quality assessment integration
- Event subscription system for automatic sync triggering

This will complete the core offline infrastructure and enable automatic
synchronization when connectivity is restored.
