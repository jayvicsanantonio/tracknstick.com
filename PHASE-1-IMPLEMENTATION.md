# Phase 1 Implementation - React Router Setup and Feature Flag

## Overview

This document describes the completion of Phase 1 of the React Router
implementation plan, which includes setting up the feature flag system and
installing required dependencies.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1.1: Feature Flag Implementation

- **Feature Flag Configuration**: Created `src/config/featureFlags.ts` with
  `isUrlRoutingEnabled` flag
- **Environment Variable Control**: Feature flag is controlled by
  `VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED` environment variable
- **Conditional Rendering**: Modified `App.tsx` to conditionally render either:
  - New URL-based routing system (when feature flag is enabled)
  - Legacy state-based routing system (when feature flag is disabled)
- **Seamless Rollback**: Feature flag allows immediate rollback without
  redeployment

### ✅ Task 1.2: Install Required Dependencies

- **React Router DOM**: Installed `react-router-dom@^7.7.0`
- **TypeScript Types**: Installed `@types/react-router-dom@^5.3.3`
- **Verification**: Dependencies verified in `package.json`

## Implementation Details

### Feature Flag System

```typescript
// src/config/featureFlags.ts
export const featureFlags = {
  isUrlRoutingEnabled: import.meta.env.VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED === 'true',
};
```

### Conditional Rendering in App.tsx

```typescript
function App() {
  if (featureFlags.isUrlRoutingEnabled) {
    // New URL-based routing system
    return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
  }

  // Legacy state-based routing system
  return <Body />;
}
```

### Basic Router Configuration

Created a basic router configuration at `src/routes/index.tsx` with:

- **Dashboard Route** (`/`) - Default daily habit tracker
- **Habits Route** (`/habits`) - Habits overview/management
- **Progress Route** (`/progress`) - Progress overview
- **404 Route** (`*`) - Not found page

## Current State

- ✅ Feature flag system is operational
- ✅ Dependencies are installed
- ✅ Basic router configuration is ready
- ✅ Application builds and lints successfully
- ✅ Legacy system remains fully functional (default state)

## Environment Configuration

To enable the new routing system, set the environment variable:

```bash
VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=true
```

To use the legacy system (default):

```bash
VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
# OR simply omit the variable
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

- `src/config/featureFlags.ts` - Feature flag configuration
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - Basic router configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable documentation
- `PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:

- `src/App.tsx` - Added conditional rendering logic
- `package.json` - Added React Router dependencies

## Testing

- ✅ Application builds successfully with `pnpm build`
- ✅ Code passes linting with `pnpm lint`
- ✅ Feature flag is ready for testing in Phase 2

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Create proper page components in `src/pages/` directory
2. Update router configuration to use new page components
3. Begin integration testing with feature flag enabled
4. Prepare for component refactoring in Phase 3

## Risk Mitigation

- **Zero-downtime deployment**: Feature flag is disabled by default
- **Immediate rollback**: Can disable feature flag instantly if issues arise
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy system remains completely intact
- **Gradual rollout**: Can enable for specific environments/users

## Notes

- Current implementation uses temporary wrapper components in the router
- Fast refresh warnings in linting are expected and will be resolved in Phase 2
- All existing functionality is preserved when feature flag is disabled
