# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Track N' Stick application currently operates as a cache-first PWA, allowing
users to view previously loaded content when offline but preventing any data
creation or modification without an internet connection. This limitation
significantly reduces the app's utility during intermittent connectivity
scenarios, which are common in mobile usage patterns.

This feature will transform Track N' Stick into a true offline-first application
by implementing local data persistence, offline queue management, and
intelligent synchronization capabilities. Users will be able to create and
modify habit tracking data while offline, with all changes seamlessly syncing
when connectivity is restored. The system will handle conflicts intelligently,
ensuring data integrity while preserving user intent.

The implementation will leverage IndexedDB for robust local storage, implement a
background synchronization queue, and provide conflict resolution strategies
that prioritize user data while maintaining consistency with the server state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my habit tracking data to be stored locally,
so that I can access and modify it even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize an IndexedDB
   database with appropriate schemas for habits, entries, and sync metadata
2. WHEN a user creates or modifies habit data THEN the system SHALL immediately
   persist the changes to IndexedDB before attempting server synchronization
3. WHILE offline THE system SHALL serve all read operations from the local
   IndexedDB store
4. WHEN online AND local data exists THEN the system SHALL prioritize local data
   over server data for immediate user interactions

### Requirement 2: Offline Data Creation and Modification

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new habits and log habit entries
while offline, so that I can maintain my tracking routine regardless of
connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN offline AND user creates a new habit THEN the system SHALL store it
   locally with a temporary ID and queue it for server sync
2. WHEN offline AND user logs a habit entry THEN the system SHALL save it to
   IndexedDB and mark it for synchronization
3. WHEN offline AND user modifies existing data THEN the system SHALL update the
   local copy and track the modification timestamp
4. WHILE offline THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback confirming
   all data operations
5. IF user attempts operations requiring server validation THEN the system SHALL
   queue them and notify the user they will process when online

### Requirement 3: Background Synchronization Queue

**User Story:** As a user, I want my offline changes to automatically sync when
I regain connectivity, so that my data is consistent across devices without
manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically begin
   processing the sync queue
2. WHEN sync queue contains items THEN the system SHALL process them in
   chronological order with exponential backoff on failures
3. WHEN sync succeeds for an item THEN the system SHALL update local IDs with
   server IDs and remove the item from the queue
4. IF sync fails for an item THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before
   marking it as failed and notifying the user
5. WHILE syncing THE system SHALL display sync status to the user without
   blocking app functionality

### Requirement 4: Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently handle conflicts
when my offline changes conflict with server data, so that I don't lose
important information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server data conflicts with local changes THEN the system SHALL apply
   last-write-wins strategy based on modification timestamps
2. IF conflicts cannot be auto-resolved THEN the system SHALL present both
   versions to the user for manual resolution
3. WHEN user resolves conflicts THEN the system SHALL merge the data according
   to user selection and sync the resolution
4. WHILE conflicts exist THE system SHALL allow continued app usage while
   clearly indicating unresolved conflicts
5. WHEN habit entries conflict THEN the system SHALL preserve both entries
   unless they are identical in content and timestamp

### Requirement 5: Connectivity Detection and Status

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear indication of my connectivity status and
sync state, so that I understand when my data is local-only versus synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connectivity changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the
   connection status indicator
2. WHEN operating offline THEN the system SHALL display a persistent but
   non-intrusive offline indicator
3. WHEN sync queue has pending items THEN the system SHALL show the count of
   unsynced changes
4. WHILE syncing THE system SHALL display progress indication without blocking
   user interactions
5. IF sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
   and retry options

### Requirement 6: Data Consistency and Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the offline system to maintain data
integrity across all scenarios, so that users never experience data corruption
or loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing to IndexedDB THEN the system SHALL use transactions to ensure
   atomicity
2. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity
   before committing changes
3. IF local database corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt
   recovery from server data with user notification
4. WHEN schema updates are required THEN the system SHALL migrate existing local
   data without loss
5. WHILE operating offline THE system SHALL prevent operations that would create
   invalid data states
