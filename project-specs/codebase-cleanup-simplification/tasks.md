## Success Metrics

- **Code Complexity**: Reduce max nesting depth from 5+ to 3
- **Documentation**: 100% of public APIs documented
- **Test Coverage**: Increase from current to 80%+
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce by 20% through code splitting
- **Developer Onboarding**: New developer productive in < 1 day
- **Build Time**: Maintain or improve current build times
- **Type Safety**: 0 TypeScript errors with strict mode enabled

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1-2: 1 week (Cleanup and reorganization)
- Phase 3-4: 1 week (Integration and developer tools)
- Phase 5-6: 1 week (Quality and testing)
- Phase 7-8: 1 week (Optimization and deployment)

**Total: 4 weeks** for complete cleanup and simplification

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies required
- Can be done in parallel with feature development
- Should be done before adding new major features

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during reorganization

   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite before changes

2. **Risk**: Merge conflicts with ongoing development

   - **Mitigation**: Do cleanup in small, incremental PRs

3. **Risk**: Team resistance to new structure

   - **Mitigation**: Get team buy-in before major changes

4. **Risk**: Performance regression from abstractions
   - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks before/after

## Notes

- Prioritize high-impact, low-risk changes first
- Each phase should be a separate PR for easier review
- Consider creating a cleanup branch to avoid blocking features
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md
