# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Track N' Stick codebase has grown organically through rapid feature
development, resulting in scattered documentation, complex directory structures,
and incomplete integration of the offline-first system. While the architecture
is fundamentally sound, the current organization creates friction for
developers, especially junior engineers joining the team.

This project aims to refactor and reorganize the codebase to improve
maintainability, reduce cognitive load, and establish clear patterns for future
development. The cleanup will focus on simplifying directory structures,
consolidating related code, properly integrating the offline functionality, and
creating comprehensive documentation for developers.

The refactoring will follow industry best practices while maintaining backward
compatibility and system stability. All changes will be incremental and
reversible, allowing for safe rollout without disrupting ongoing development or
production systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean and Intuitive File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and intuitive file structure, so
that I can quickly locate and understand code without unnecessary navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the root directory THEN there SHALL be no session files,
   temporary documentation, or development artifacts
2. WHEN navigating the source tree THEN no directory SHALL have more than 3
   levels of nesting from its parent feature folder
3. WHEN searching for functionality THEN related code SHALL be co-located within
   the same feature directory
4. WHEN examining any directory THEN empty folders and unused files SHALL NOT
   exist
5. IF multiple directories serve similar purposes THEN they SHALL be
   consolidated into a single, well-named location

### Requirement 2: Complete and Current Documentation

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want comprehensive and up-to-date
documentation, so that I can become productive quickly without extensive
mentoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN all docs SHALL reflect the current
   architecture and implementation
2. WHEN reading the developer guide THEN it SHALL provide clear onboarding steps
   that work on first attempt
3. WHEN viewing any public API or complex function THEN it SHALL have complete
   JSDoc documentation
4. WHILE reviewing documentation THE system SHALL NOT contain outdated or
   conflicting information
5. IF architectural decisions exist THEN they SHALL be documented in
   Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Requirement 3: Simplified Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a junior developer, I want clear patterns and helpful
tooling, so that I can contribute effectively without deep system knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new components THEN templates SHALL be available with proper
   TypeScript and testing setup
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN developer tools SHALL provide database inspection
   and state management utilities
3. WHEN running the application locally THEN clear logging SHALL indicate system
   state without console pollution
4. WHILE developing THE system SHALL provide immediate feedback through proper
   error boundaries and loading states
5. IF common tasks exist THEN they SHALL be automated through scripts or code
   generators

### Requirement 4: Proper Offline System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the offline functionality to work seamlessly,
so that I can use the app regardless of connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN offline-enabled hooks SHALL be used by
   default for all data operations
2. WHEN offline functionality fails THEN error boundaries SHALL provide graceful
   degradation
3. WHEN viewing the UI THEN proper loading states and progress indicators SHALL
   replace text-only placeholders
4. WHILE offline THE system SHALL clearly indicate its state through consistent
   UI elements
5. IF feature flags are needed THEN they SHALL allow gradual rollout of offline
   functionality

### Requirement 5: Enforced Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want enforced code quality standards, so that
the codebase maintains consistency regardless of contributor experience level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling TypeScript THEN strict mode SHALL be enabled with zero type
   errors
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN no console.log statements SHALL exist in production
   builds
3. WHEN examining configuration THEN all magic numbers SHALL be extracted to
   named constants
4. WHILE developing THE system SHALL enforce consistent patterns through linting
   and formatting
5. IF type safety issues exist THEN they SHALL be caught at compile time, not
   runtime

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I
can refactor confidently without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN coverage SHALL be at least 80% for critical paths
2. WHEN viewing test files THEN they SHALL be co-located with their source files
3. WHEN testing offline functionality THEN integration tests SHALL verify
   end-to-end workflows
4. WHILE refactoring THE test suite SHALL catch regressions before code review
5. IF new features are added THEN corresponding tests SHALL be required for
   merge approval

### Requirement 7: Optimized Performance and Bundle Size

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast application performance, so that my
experience is smooth regardless of device or network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the bundle THEN the offline module SHALL be code-split for
   lazy loading
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN build times SHALL not exceed current
   baselines
3. WHEN loading the application THEN initial bundle size SHALL be reduced by at
   least 20%
4. WHILE running THE application SHALL maintain or improve current performance
   metrics
5. IF heavy components exist THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded on demand

### Requirement 8: Production-Ready Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want clear deployment procedures and
monitoring, so that I can safely release and maintain the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying changes THEN feature flags SHALL allow controlled rollout
2. WHEN monitoring production THEN offline usage metrics SHALL be tracked and
   visible
3. WHEN issues occur THEN comprehensive error tracking SHALL provide actionable
   insights
4. WHILE running in production THE system SHALL have documented rollback
   procedures
5. IF critical errors occur THEN alerts SHALL trigger within 5 minutes
