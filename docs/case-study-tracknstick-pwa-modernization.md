# Track N' Stick: Modern PWA Habit Tracking Platform

**Timeline:** 2025-01-01 – 2025-09-18 • **Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite,
PWA • **Repo:** tracknstick.com

> **Executive summary:** Architected and delivered a production-ready
> Progressive Web App for habit tracking, achieving 98/100 Lighthouse
> performance score, ~585KB gzipped bundle size, and comprehensive PWA
> compliance. Modernized the entire tech stack from legacy patterns to React 19
> with TypeScript strict mode, implementing feature-driven architecture with
> offline capabilities.

## Context

Track N' Stick serves users seeking to build and maintain healthy habits through
data-driven insights and gamification. The platform targets productivity-focused
individuals who need reliable habit tracking with real-time analytics,
achievement systems, and cross-platform accessibility. With the growing demand
for installable web apps and offline functionality, the project required a
complete modernization to compete with native mobile applications.

## Problem

The original implementation lacked modern web capabilities and suffered from
several technical limitations:

- No offline functionality or PWA features (0/100 PWA score)
- Legacy React patterns without TypeScript strict mode
- Monolithic component architecture hindering maintainability
- Missing performance optimizations (bundle size >2MB uncompressed)
- No automated testing or CI/CD workflows
- Limited mobile responsiveness and accessibility

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: 8-month development window with solo development
- **Legacy Code**: Existing user base requiring backward compatibility
- **Performance Budget**: <3s loading time, <600KB gzipped bundle
- **Browser Support**: Safari/Chrome parity with PWA installation
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for all screen sizes and orientations
- **Offline Support**: Core functionality must work without internet

## Options Considered

• **Next.js Migration**: Full framework migration for SSR/SSG benefits.
**Trade-offs**: Complex migration, unnecessary server-side features.
**Rejected**: Overkill for client-side PWA.

• **Incremental Modernization**: Gradual updates while maintaining existing
structure. **Trade-offs**: Faster delivery, technical debt accumulation.
**Rejected**: Would perpetuate architectural issues.

• **Complete Rewrite with Modern Stack**: Fresh React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
implementation. **Trade-offs**: Longer timeline, cleaner architecture.
**Chosen**: Best long-term maintainability and performance.

The complete rewrite was selected due to architectural debt and the need for
comprehensive PWA features that required fundamental changes to the application
structure.

## Implementation Highlights

• **PWA Architecture**: Implemented Workbox service worker with intelligent
caching strategies. CacheFirst for static assets, NetworkFirst for API calls
with 24-hour expiration. Achieved perfect 100/100 PWA score with installability
and offline support. [vite.config.ts:34-72](vite.config.ts#L34)

• **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 2.77s build time with strategic code
splitting. Manual chunks for vendor libraries (React/DOM), UI components
(Radix), charts (Recharts), and icons (Lucide). Bundle size reduced to 585KB
gzipped through tree shaking and dead code elimination.
[vite.config.ts:76-90](vite.config.ts#L76)

• **Feature-Driven Architecture**: Organized codebase into feature modules
(habits/, progress/, layout/) with clear separation of concerns. Each feature
exports through index.ts with defined API boundaries. TypeScript strict mode
enforced across 66 feature files with comprehensive type coverage.
[src/features/](src/features/)

• **Authentication & API Integration**: Integrated Clerk authentication with
automatic JWT token attachment via Axios interceptors. API client configured
with base URL from environment variables supporting both development and
production endpoints. [docs/README.md:162-167](README.md#L162)

• **Testing Strategy**: Implemented comprehensive test suite with Vitest and
React Testing Library. 30 tests covering routing, components, hooks, and
integration scenarios. All tests passing with sub-second execution (978ms
total).
[docs/artifacts/test-results-20250918.md](docs/artifacts/test-results-20250918.md)

• **Modern Tooling**: Leveraged Vite 6.3.5 for ultra-fast HMR and optimized
builds. ESLint 9+ with TypeScript-aware rules, Prettier formatting, and Husky
pre-commit hooks ensuring code quality. Tailwind CSS v4 with native CSS features
for styling consistency.

• **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured Safari/Chrome parity with CSS
transforms, backdrop-filter fallbacks, and PWA manifest compatibility. Service
worker registration handled gracefully across all modern browsers.

## Validation

**Performance Testing**: Local Lighthouse audits confirmed 98/100 performance
score with optimized Core Web Vitals. Build output analysis documented in
[docs/artifacts/build-analysis-20250918.md](docs/artifacts/build-analysis-20250918.md).

**PWA Compliance**: Verified installability across desktop and mobile platforms.
Service worker functionality tested with offline scenarios and background sync
capabilities.

**Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode enforced with 100% type coverage across
all source files. No type errors in production build compilation.

**Cross-Platform Testing**: Responsive design validated across screen sizes with
mobile-first approach. Safari and Chrome PWA installation verified on multiple
devices.

## Risks & Follow-ups

**Technical Debt**: Service worker cache invalidation requires monitoring to
prevent stale data issues. Priority: High.

**Performance Monitoring**: Need to implement Core Web Vitals tracking in
production to maintain performance standards. Priority: Medium.

**Test Coverage**: While routing and component tests exist, integration with
external APIs needs comprehensive E2E testing. Priority: Medium.

**Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance claimed but requires formal audit and
automated testing integration. Priority: Low.

**Bundle Optimization**: Icon library (151KB gzipped) could be tree-shaken
further with dynamic imports. Priority: Low.

## Collaboration

**Solo Development**: Full-stack implementation by Principal Software Engineer
with architecture decisions, implementation, and testing responsibilities.

**Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation maintained in
[docs/](docs/) directory including implementation plans, refactoring strategies,
and PWA guidelines.

**Community**: Open-source project with MIT license encouraging contributions
through standardized development workflow.
