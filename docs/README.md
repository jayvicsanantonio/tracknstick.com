## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to the project, start with:

1. **[Current Architecture](./CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Understand the system
2. **[Developer Guide](./guides/getting-started.md)** - Set up your environment
3. **[Project Specs](../project-specs/)** - Review active project specifications

## üìã Active Specifications

The `/project-specs` directory contains active project specifications:

- **[Offline-First Data Management](../project-specs/offline-first-data-management/)** -
  Offline capabilities implementation
- **[Codebase Cleanup & Simplification](../project-specs/codebase-cleanup-simplification/)** -
  Code organization and cleanup

## üîß For Developers

### Setting Up

See the [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting-started.md) for development
environment setup.

### Contributing

Before contributing, review:

- Current architecture and patterns
- Active project specifications
- Coding standards and conventions

### Testing

Refer to the testing documentation in `/guides` for testing strategies and best
practices.

## üìù Documentation Standards

When adding new documentation:

1. **Location**: Place docs in the appropriate subdirectory
2. **Naming**: Use UPPERCASE for major docs (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`), lowercase
   for guides
3. **Format**: Use Markdown with clear headers and sections
4. **Linking**: Update this README when adding significant new documentation
5. **Archiving**: Move outdated docs to `/archive` rather than deleting

## üóÇ Archived Content

Historical documentation has been preserved in `/archive`:

- Development session notes from the offline-first implementation
- Previous implementation phases and strategies
- Superseded architectural decisions

These are kept for reference but should not be used for current development.

## üìû Contact

For questions about the documentation or project:

- Check the [Current Architecture](./CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) first
- Review relevant project specifications
- Consult the development team
