# Phase 6: React Router Rollout and Monitoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the rollout and monitoring strategy for the React Router
implementation in tracknstick.com. The rollout will be conducted in phases using
the `isUrlRoutingEnabled` feature flag to ensure stability and allow for
immediate rollback if issues arise.

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation (Day 1)

#### Checklist

- [ ] Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Verify feature flag is set to `false` in production environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts
- [ ] Brief support team on potential issues and rollback procedures
- [ ] Create rollback documentation accessible to all team members

#### Deployment Configuration

```bash
# Production .env configuration
VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
```

### Phase 2: Internal Testing (Days 2-3)

#### Participants

- Development team members
- QA team
- Product stakeholders

#### Testing Procedure

1. Enable feature flag for internal users only
2. Test all critical user flows:
   - Authentication (sign in/sign out)
   - Navigation between all routes
   - Browser back/forward functionality
   - Direct URL access
   - Page refresh on all routes
   - Mobile browser compatibility

#### Monitoring Focus

- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Network errors (404s on route navigation)
- Performance metrics (page load times)
- User session continuity

### Phase 3: Canary Release (Days 4-7)

#### 5% User Rollout

- Enable feature flag for 5% of production users
- Monitor for 48 hours before proceeding

#### Success Criteria

- Error rate remains below 0.1%
- No increase in user complaints
- Performance metrics remain stable
- No authentication issues reported

### Phase 4: Expanded Release (Days 8-10)

#### 25% User Rollout

- Increase feature flag to 25% of users
- Continue monitoring all metrics
- Gather user feedback through in-app surveys

#### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Page load times
- Navigation success rates
- Browser compatibility issues
- User engagement metrics

### Phase 5: Majority Release (Days 11-13)

#### 50% User Rollout

- Enable for half of all users
- Conduct A/B testing analysis
- Compare navigation patterns between old and new systems

### Phase 6: Full Release (Day 14+)

#### 100% User Rollout

- Enable for all users
- Keep feature flag in place for emergency rollback
- Monitor for edge cases and long-tail issues

## Monitoring Setup

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Technical Metrics**

   - Page Load Time (target: <2s)
   - Time to Interactive (target: <3s)
   - JavaScript Error Rate (target: <0.1%)
   - 404 Error Rate (target: <0.01%)

2. **User Experience Metrics**

   - Navigation Success Rate (target: >99.9%)
   - Browser Back/Forward Usage (baseline comparison)
   - Direct URL Access Success (target: 100%)
   - Session Duration (should not decrease)

3. **Business Metrics**
   - User Engagement (habit tracking frequency)
   - Feature Adoption (usage of different views)
   - User Retention (should not decrease)

### Monitoring Tools

1. **Browser Monitoring**

   - Set up error tracking for JavaScript exceptions
   - Monitor console errors related to routing
   - Track failed navigation attempts

2. **Performance Monitoring**

   - Page load performance by route
   - Bundle size impact analysis
   - Memory usage patterns

3. **User Analytics**
   - Navigation flow analysis
   - Feature usage by route
   - User feedback collection

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers

- Error rate spike above 1%
- Authentication failures affecting >0.1% of users
- Performance degradation >20%
- Critical functionality broken

### Rollback Process

1. **Immediate Action** (< 5 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Update production environment
   VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
   ```

   - No code deployment required
   - Change takes effect on next page load

2. **Communication**

   - Notify development team via Slack
   - Update status page if applicable
   - Document issue for post-mortem

3. **Investigation**
   - Collect error logs and user reports
   - Reproduce issue in staging environment
   - Plan fix before re-attempting rollout

## User Communication Strategy

### Pre-Rollout

- No user communication needed (transparent change)

### During Rollout

- Monitor support channels for confusion
- Prepare FAQ for common questions:
  - "Why did my URL change?"
  - "How do I bookmark pages now?"
  - "Can I share links to specific pages?"

### Post-Rollout

- Announce new capabilities in release notes:
  - Bookmarkable pages
  - Shareable links
  - Better browser navigation

## Success Validation

### Technical Success Criteria

- [ ] All routes accessible via direct URL
- [ ] Browser history working correctly
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] Performance metrics stable or improved

### User Success Criteria

- [ ] No increase in support tickets
- [ ] Positive or neutral user feedback
- [ ] Maintained or improved engagement metrics
- [ ] Successful adoption of URL sharing features

## Long-term Monitoring

### 30-Day Review

- Analyze complete metrics dataset
- Identify any patterns in edge cases
- Plan for feature flag removal
- Document lessons learned

### Feature Flag Retirement

- After 30 days of stable operation
- Remove flag from codebase
- Clean up legacy navigation code
- Update documentation

## Appendix: Monitoring Queries

### Error Rate Monitoring

```javascript
// Example monitoring query
const routingErrors = errors.filter(
  (e) =>
    e.message.includes('router') ||
    e.message.includes('navigation') ||
    e.stack.includes('react-router'),
);
```

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Route performance tracking
const routeMetrics = {
  '/': { loadTime: [], errorCount: 0 },
  '/habits': { loadTime: [], errorCount: 0 },
  '/progress': { loadTime: [], errorCount: 0 },
};
```

This rollout strategy ensures a safe, measured deployment of React Router while
maintaining the ability to instantly revert if issues arise. The gradual rollout
allows for early detection of problems while minimizing user impact.
