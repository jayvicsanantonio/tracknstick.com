# Phase 6 Implementation: Rollout and Monitoring

## Overview

Phase 6 focuses on the gradual rollout and monitoring of the React Router
implementation. This phase establishes monitoring utilities, rollout procedures,
and success validation criteria to ensure a smooth transition from state-based
to URL-based navigation.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Monitoring Utilities Created

#### File: `src/utils/monitoring.ts`

We've implemented a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks:

- **Route Performance Metrics**
  - Page load times for each route
  - Error counts and rates
  - Visit counts and patterns
- **Navigation Behavior**

  - Browser back/forward usage
  - Direct URL access
  - Link click navigation
  - Navigation type detection

- **Key Features**
  - Automatic error threshold detection (alerts at >1% error rate)
  - Performance tracking with memory optimization
  - Real-time metrics logging
  - Export functionality for external monitoring services

### 2. Page Components Enhanced with Monitoring

Updated all page components to include route monitoring:

- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Tracks `/` route performance
- `src/pages/HabitsPage.tsx` - Tracks `/habits` route performance
- `src/pages/ProgressPage.tsx` - Tracks `/progress` route performance

Each page now automatically:

- Records load time when the component mounts
- Tracks visit frequency
- Reports any rendering errors

### 3. Navigation Tracking in Header Component

Enhanced `src/features/layout/components/Header.tsx` to:

- Track navigation link clicks
- Differentiate between navigation types
- Maintain metrics for user behavior analysis

### 4. Rollout Strategy Documentation

Created `PHASE-6-ROLLOUT-STRATEGY.md` which includes:

- **Phased Rollout Plan**

  - Pre-deployment preparation checklist
  - Internal testing (Days 2-3)
  - Canary release at 5% (Days 4-7)
  - Expanded release at 25% (Days 8-10)
  - Majority release at 50% (Days 11-13)
  - Full release at 100% (Day 14+)

- **Monitoring KPIs**

  - Technical metrics (load time, error rates)
  - User experience metrics (navigation success, session duration)
  - Business metrics (engagement, retention)

- **Rollback Procedures**
  - Immediate rollback triggers
  - Step-by-step rollback process
  - Communication templates

## Current State

### Feature Flag Configuration

The feature flag is currently **disabled** in production:

```bash
VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
```

### Monitoring Active

When the feature flag is enabled, the monitoring system will:

- Automatically track all route visits
- Log performance metrics every 10 visits
- Alert on error rate thresholds
- Export metrics for analysis

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run all tests to ensure stability

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

- [ ] Build the application to verify no build errors

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

- [ ] Test with feature flag enabled locally
  ```bash
  VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=true pnpm dev
  ```

### 2. Internal Testing Phase

To begin internal testing:

1. **Enable for Development Team**

   - Set `VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=true` for internal users
   - Test all critical user flows
   - Monitor console for routing metrics

2. **Validation Checklist**

   - [ ] Authentication flow works correctly
   - [ ] All navigation links function properly
   - [ ] Browser back/forward works as expected
   - [ ] Direct URL access loads correct pages
   - [ ] Page refresh maintains current route
   - [ ] No console errors related to routing

3. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Check console logs for `[Routing Metrics]` output
   - Verify error rates stay below 0.1%
   - Confirm load times are acceptable (<2s)

### 3. Production Rollout

When ready for production:

1. **Deploy with Flag Disabled**

   ```bash
   # Production deployment
   VITE_URL_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
   ```

2. **Enable for Canary Group**

   - Use feature flag service or environment variable
   - Start with 5% of users
   - Monitor for 48 hours

3. **Gradual Expansion**
   - Increase to 25% after successful canary
   - Then 50%, monitoring at each stage
   - Finally 100% when metrics are stable

## Monitoring During Rollout

### Real-time Monitoring

The monitoring system logs metrics every 10 route visits:

```
[Routing Metrics] {
  routes: {
    '/': { avgLoadTime: 145, errorRate: 0, visitCount: 15 },
    '/habits': { avgLoadTime: 203, errorRate: 0, visitCount: 8 },
    '/progress': { avgLoadTime: 178, errorRate: 0, visitCount: 5 }
  },
  navigation: {
    browserBackCount: 3,
    browserForwardCount: 1,
    directUrlAccessCount: 2,
    linkClickCount: 22
  },
  overall: {
    totalErrors: 0,
    totalVisits: 28,
    avgLoadTime: 167
  }
}
```

### Error Detection

Automatic alerts trigger when:

- Error rate exceeds 1%
- After at least 10 visits (to avoid false positives)

Example alert:

```
[ALERT] Error rate exceeds threshold: {
  errorRate: "1.25%",
  totalErrors: 3,
  totalVisits: 240
}
```

### Export Metrics

Access comprehensive metrics programmatically:

```javascript
import { routingMonitor } from '@/utils/monitoring';

// Get current metrics summary
const metrics = routingMonitor.getMetricsSummary();

// Export for external monitoring
const exportData = routingMonitor.exportMetrics();
```

## Conclusion

Phase 6 successfully implements a robust monitoring and rollout framework for
the React Router migration. The monitoring utilities provide real-time insights
into performance and user behavior, while the phased rollout strategy ensures a
safe transition with minimal risk to users.

The application is now ready for the rollout process to begin, starting with
internal testing and gradually expanding to all users based on monitoring data
and success metrics.
